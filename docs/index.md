This is my personal wiki where I share everything I know about this world in
form of an online [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) book hosted on
[GitHub](https://github.com/lyz-code/blue-book).

If this is your first time visiting this wiki, take a look at [meta](meta.md),
as it describes this wiki, its structure and goals in more detail.

# Using the wiki well

You can quickly search the contents of this wiki above or you can explore the
tree view to the left.

Start with the first article that grabs your attention and be ready to
incrementally read the rest.

Or you can use it as a reference, cloning the [git
repository](https://github.com/lyz-code/blue-book) and using grep.

# Make your own wiki

Don't be afraid to create one of your own and share what you know with the
world. If you don't want to build your own, I invite you to use a fork of
mine and make [contributions](#contributing). I would love to see the blue-book
maintained by several people.

You can view [other similar continuously updated
wikis](https://github.com/RichardLitt/meta-knowledge#readme) to get inspiration.

# Contributing

If you find a mistake anywhere in this wiki or want to add new content, I'll
be glad to accept your contribution. You can quickly find any entry you wish to
edit by [searching for the
topic](https://github.com/lyz-code/blue-book/find/master) or use the edit button
on the top right of any article to add your changes with a PR.

I also appreciate any [ideas you
have](https://github.com/lyz-code/blue-book/issues/new) on how I can
improve this wiki.

And if you don't want to go through the hassle of building your own, you
can use mine

# Thank you

If you liked my book and want to make me happy, please see if you know how could
I fulfill any item of my [wish list](wish_list.md) or see if you want to
contribute to [my other projects](projects.md).
